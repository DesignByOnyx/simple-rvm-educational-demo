# simple-rvm-eductional-demo

This is a simple demo repo for showcasing react, webpack, and react-view-model. The `public/app` directory contains an evolution of app components, starting with the most basic of react compononts to a rich routing-enabled component with observable state.

**Installation:**

```
git clone https://github.com/DesignByOnyx/simple-rvm-eductional-demo.git
cd simple-rvm-eductional-demo
npm i
```

**Run the app:**

```
npm run dev
```

**Enabling "watch" mode**

1. Make sure the app is running
2. Open a separate terminal session and run the following command:
    
    ```
    npm run watch
    ```

Any time you change a file, weback will automatically rebuild your bundle. You will need to refresh your browser window. I will leave "hot module reloading" as an excercise for the user.
